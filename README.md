The current project is an assignment to practice all the HTML knowledge I've acquired. I will have
demonstrated skills in launching a website using linux terminal, Git Hub, Visual Studio, and HTML.

The main idea behind this lesson is to commit a workflow and all the elements and attributes I've
learned to memory.
