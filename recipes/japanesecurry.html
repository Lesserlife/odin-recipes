        <h2>A Bite of Japanese Curry History</h2>
        <p>Curry was introduced to Japan in the late 1800s by the British and they were originally Western-style stews mixed with curry powder. The Japanese adapted curry to their own version and &OpenCurlyQuote;Curry Rice&CloseCurlyQuote; (Kare Raisu, カレーライス) was born soon after. By the 1950s, S&B Foods developed a convenient instant mix — known as curry roux — in block form so everyone could make curry rice easily at home.
        <p>Today, curry has become a staple of the Japanese home and is widely available in restaurants and food halls in departmental stores. The popularity even extends beyond Japan, and you can find its presence in many other Asian countries.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&frac12; lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs</strong> (you can also use beef, pork, seafood, tofu, mushrooms, or more vegetables)</li>
                <li><strong>&frac14; tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</strong> (lightly season or skip if you're using store-bought curry roux)</li>
                <li><strong> Freshly ground black pepper</strong></li>
                <li><strong>2 carrots</strong>(6.7 oz, 190 g)</li>
                <li><strong>2 onions (large; 1.5 lb, 670 g)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>3 Yukon gold potatoes</strong> (15 oz, 432 g; you can use 2 russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking; use Yukon gold potatoes to hold their shape)</li>
                <li><strong>1 knob ginger </strong>(you will need 1 tsp grated ginger)</li>
                <li><strong>2 cloves garlic</strong></li>
                <li><strong>&frac12; apple </strong>(6 oz, 170 g; I use one whole lunchbox Fuji apple)</li>
                <li><strong>1&frac12; Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</strong>(vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Curry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4 cups Chicken Stock/Broth</strong> homemade or store bought) (if you're using store-bought curry roux and worry about too much salt, use water only or half stock and half water)</li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp honey</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp soy sauce</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp ketchup</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 package Japanese curry roux </strong>(7-8 oz or 200-230 g; in this recipe, I used 6-7 cubes of my homemade curry roux, or about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn't solidified yet)</li>
            <li><strong>2-4 tsp kosher salt </strong>(Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) (for homemade curry roux only; taste and add salt to your liking as each brand of chicken stock varies in saltiness; skip if you're using store-bought curry roux)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 servings <strong>cooked Japanese short-grain rice</strong></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/fukujinzuke/">fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables)</a></li>
